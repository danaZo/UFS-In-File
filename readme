Exercise number 7 : unix file system
by: Dana Zorohov, Noam Vanunu.

BONUS:
we implemented our errno, called 'myErrno'.
myErrno is a variable that looks like it is global,
but in fact exists once per threadâ€”i.e., it lives in thread-local storage.
to to so, we defined the variable with the keyword _Thread_local that is used to
define thread-local variables.   

C++11 introduces the thread_local[2] keyword which can be used in the following cases:
-Namespace level (global) variables
-File static variables
-Function static variables
-Static member variables

To sum up, we implemented both of the bonuses, we created our errno with thread local storage.
